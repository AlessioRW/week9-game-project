move animation logic into seperate function, animations will onyl be decided in there

MVP:
    html page styling, logo & background
    intro screen
    ---movement system 
    ---animations correctly accompanying movements
    ---platform rendering funtion using 2d array of objects containing platform information for each stage
    ---movement between stage/screen vertically
    >= 5 floor platformer stage

extra:
    enemies/threats -> player death
    possible enemies/threats:
        arrows from walls
        small moving thing (like goomba)
    death screen

stage system note 
no platform cat touch either the bottom or top of the screen without having a platform on the
following or previous screen connecting to it otherwise there will be collision box errors where the platform loads
onto the player


Stage system -- Done

all the platform objects will be generated in the creation funciton and pushed into a 2d array from the seed data.
when the player moves up or down a stage, the platform objects and the platforms colliders with the player
of the stage before will have visibility and active set to false. (the colliders will be stored alongside the platform objects)

the render function will take a stage and make the stages platforms and colliders visible and active

--- Done

animation hierarchy --

if inAir:
    falling down -- if in air && vel y is down
    jumping up -- if in air && vel y is up

else:
    if preJump:
        preJump
    else:
        if running:
            if crouching:
                crouch walk 
            else:
                run
        else:
            if crouched:
                crouch idle
            else:
                idle
